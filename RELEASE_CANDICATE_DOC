Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 0.14.0 release candidate

Hi all!

The Ruboto 0.14.0 release candidate is now available.

In this release we change the startup to use a separate SplashActivity.
This simplifies the startup and makes it more robust.

As always we need your help and feedback to ensure the quality of the release.  Please install the release candidate using

    [sudo] gem install ruboto --pre

and test your apps after updating with

    ruboto update app

If you have an app released for public consumption, please let us know.  Our developer program seeks to help developers getting started using Ruboto, and ensure good quality across Ruboto releases.  Currently we are supporting the apps listed here:

    https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto/wiki/Promoted-apps

If you are just starting with Ruboto, but still want to contribute, please select and complete one of the tutorials and mark it with the version of Ruboto you used.

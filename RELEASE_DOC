Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 0.14.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 0.14.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 0.14.0:

In this release we change the startup to use a separate SplashActivity.
This simplifies the startup and makes it more robust.

Features:

* Issue #433 Tests: add support for individual/matrix tests in Windows
* Issue #460 New startup sequence with SplashActivity
* Issue #471 Allow sending Intent extras with start_ruboto_activity
* Issue #473 Modify EntryPointActivity to send an Intent to SplashActivity

Bugfixes:

* Issue #428 Splash requests window feature too late
* Issue #429 ruboto emulator -t android-17 fails
* Issue #432 'ruboto update app' leaves some old files behind
* Issue #434 After JRuby is loaded, check the activity state before
  calling onCreate
* Issue #442 Adding splash.xml crashes app.
* Issue #443 onCreateOptionsMenu (and other callbacks) not called on first
  time startup
* Issue #449 Change ruboto setup to use /linux/ instead of /^linux(.*)/
* Issue #451 Changing device orientation during splash causes exception
* Issue #453 Builds but fails to load ruby scripts on uppercase package
  name
* Issue #455 Rake install fails in ruboto-0.14.0-dev
* Issue #468 Using the EntryPointActivity check in the RubotoActivity
  template doesn't work for other activities like PreferencesActivity
* Issue #470 "ruboto update app" deletes "src/ruboto/.svn" subversion
  directory

Support:

* Issue #446 Bad call from ruboto setup
* Issue #450 Application aborts prematurely, when I add a Gemfile.apk

Documentation:

* Issue #225 Investigate AIDE
* Issue #430 Add Downloads page to ruboto.org

Pull requests:

* Issue #439 Fixes #432
* Issue #440 Added check for compatible APIs for update examples: re issue
  #437
* Issue #444 Fix building on Windows caused by mixed file separators. Also
  pre-compressed the included PNGs with optipng, despite included pngcrush
  during rake for increased loseless file compression.
* Issue #454 Fix android_package_directory for ones already installed
  android sdk
* Issue #457 Allow uppercase package name
* Issue #462 Add SplashActivity for new startup sequence
* Issue #463 New APK size upper limit in test/ruboto_gen_test
* Issue #464 Fix #451 by locking screen orientation of SplashActivity

Internal:

* Issue #436 Use "ruboto emulator" instead of start_emulator.sh when
  running tests on travis-ci
